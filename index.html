                My name is <strong>Tasawar Saraf</strong> or you can just call me Taz for short. I go to Lehigh University studying computer science. 
                        I have a large family consisting of three brothers (myself included) and two sisters. My interest in development 
                        came about when I was in my junior year of high school. Ever since then I been developing on fun projects.

                <strong>Longboarding</strong>: It wasn't until high school when I got into longboarding. My cousin bought me a pennyboard at first and 
                I would have so much fun cruising around the area. Eventually I bought the longboard where then 
                I was able to cruise much more smoothly and for longer distances.

              <p class="subtitle">
                  <strong>Video Games</strong>: I was always fond of video games my whole life. Video game for me is an escape from 
                  reality to sit and enjoy with my friends when I am having a stressfull day.

              <p class="subtitle">
                    <strong>Biking</strong>: I started biking at the age of 12. I love to bike for long distance 
                    travels with my friends and to also commute to work or school.
